/**
 * Each ScanJob has its own BulkScanWorker. This class manages the BulkScanWorkers and ensures that
 * each BulkScanWorker is only created once and is cleaned up after it is not used anymore.
 * <p>
 * More concretely: If a scan with ID 1 is started, a worker is created. This worker will exist as long as scan targets
 * for scan ID 1 are processed. If the worker does not receive jobs for more than 30 Minutes, it is considered stale.
 * Upon receiving a new job, stale workers are removed.
 * I.e. if after 30 mins a new ID 1 job arrives, the worker persists.
 * If a new ID 2 job arrives, a worker for that is created, and stale workers are removed.
 * <p>
 * This class manages the mechanism above and acts as a singleton factory and manager for BulkScanWorker instances.
